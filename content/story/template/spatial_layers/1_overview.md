Work in progress.
- Avoid loading large files directly into the app, big performance hit. (The page will load more slowly for viewers, and other problems).
- Large files can be hosted on the Data Portal.
- Files can also be stored as geojson directly within the content directory.
- Project to WGS84 or WebMerc
