### Background

Scientists often work at different scales to analyze different parts of a landscape or ecosystem. We can study ecosystems at different scales across **space** (i.e., spatial scale) or across **time** (i.e., temporal scale). We can also ask “**how big?**” (i.e., what is the extent?) or “**how much detail?**” (i.e., what is the resolution?).
