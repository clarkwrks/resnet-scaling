We, as scientists and researchers, often take a multi-scale perspective to better understand how natural ecosystems improve people’s lives. These beneficial contributions by ecosystems are called **Nature’s contributions to people**, NCPs. NCPs can also be called nature’s gifts or ecosystem services.

Taking a **multi-scale perspective**, means that we can measure things at **fine or small scales**, for example at the scale of ants or even smaller by measuring carbon in a handful of soil and we can use instruments at **broad or large scales** that give us a bird's eye perspective of larger ecological patterns and processes.

We are part of **ResNet**, a network which unites a broad community of scholars, nongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and industry sectors. We work in different regions of Canada, with a common goal of improving how we monitor, model, and manage nature’s contributions to people. In the sections below, together as a subset of members of ResNet, we 

1) discuss the importance of taking a multi-scale perspective,

2) define what we mean by spatial and temporal scales, and

3) introduce a few challenges and best practices related to scaling.

As scientists and researchers, we often design studies at different scales, because 

1) decision-makers require data at different spatio-temporal scales, 

2) scientists seek to understand how ecosystem processes and properties vary across scales, and 

3) there are cost and time constraints to collecting data; therefore, we target the scale most relevant for a given question or decision.

Sometimes data is only available (or can only be collected) at one scale; however, we need information at a different scale to inform a decision or to understand an ecological process. We may scale up or down for many reasons, including…
   
1) It can be expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous to **collect data in the field** at every possible location. Instead, we divide a larger landscape into smaller similar areas and take representative samples within each group.

2) Ecological processes can be difficult to observe directly, including when **processes are too fast, too slow, too small, or too large**. We develop models to visualize a reality that is inaccessible to our senses. 

3) **Management and policy decisions** may require data at a different scale (e.g., study area or amount of detail) compared to the scale of available data. For example, we may collect field data about a management intervention within a smaller local study area; however, we may rely on models to test how scaling these interventions could affect outcomes for a broader larger study region.

4) Sometimes data are only available for a large region (e.g., population data of a neighborhood), but we may **need data at a finer resolution** to answer key questions (e.g., how many people within a neighborhood live along a river prone to flooding?).
