description: "We, as scientists and researchers, often take a multi-scale perspective to better understand how natural ecosystems improve peopleâ€™s lives. Taking a multi-scale perspective, means that we can measure things at fine or small scales, for example at the scale of ants or even smaller by measuring carbon in a handful of soil and we can use instruments at broad or large scales that give us a bird's eye perspective of larger ecological patterns and processes."
