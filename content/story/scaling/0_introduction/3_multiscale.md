### A multi-scale perspective

As scientists and researchers, we often design studies at different scales, because:

1. decision-makers require data at different spatio-temporal scales,  
2. scientists seek to understand how ecosystem processes and properties vary across scales, and  
3. there are cost and time constraints to collecting data; therefore, we target the scale most relevant for a given question or decision.

Sometimes data is only available (or can only be collected) at one scale; however, we may need information at a different scale to inform a decision or to understand an ecological process. We may scale up or down for many reasons, includingâ€¦

1. it can be expensive, time-consuming, and dangerous to **collect data in the field** at every possible location. Instead, we divide a larger landscape into smaller similar areas and take representative samples within each group.  
2. ecological processes can be difficult to observe directly, including when **processes are too fast, too slow, too small, or too large**. We develop models to visualise a reality that is inaccessible to our senses.  
3. **management and policy decisions** may require data and/or information at a different scale compared to the scale of available data. For example, while the implementation of a municipality management plan may require data at the level of neighbourhoods, research models, which are usually run over broad extents, require data with regional or national coverage.  
4. sometimes data is only available for a large region but we may **need data at a finer resolution** to answer key questions. For example, we may want to know how many people within city neighbourhoods or villages live along a river prone to flooding. However, we may only have population data at the larger city or county levels.
