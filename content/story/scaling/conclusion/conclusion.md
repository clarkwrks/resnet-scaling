### Conclusion

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center fst-italic fw-light">
Things change as we change scales.
</blockquote>

Environmental processes & properties can shift as we change scales — whether in terms of spatial or temporal resolution and extent. For this reason, our methodological decisions can produce misleading results as we expand our research to other scales. In this story map, we illustrated some of these challenges through several case studies.   


Here we explore the challenges of scale in ecosystem services science and share some practical strategies to tackle them. Whether you are an undergraduate who is just starting out or a researcher diving deeper into this field, the issues and  best practices showcased here can help you navigate similar challenges in your research.   


Research within ResNet takes place across Canada. Here, we show the approximate location of the case studies presented here. These are a subset of research projects within ResNet.
