People obtain many benefits from ecosystems (sometimes called **ecosystem services** (ES) or **nature’s contributions to people** (NCPs)). As <a href="https://www.nsercresnet.ca/" target="_blank">**NSERC ResNet**</a> researchers, we have studied these benefits at  different scales. This story map provides a summary of some of our work related to scales and the lessons we have learned.

Taking a **multi-scale perspective** means that we can measure things at **fine or small scales**, for example measuring carbon in a handful of soil, or at  **broad or large scales**, for example when studying a landscape of fields and forests by using techniques like remote sensing that give us a bird’s eye perspective of larger ecological patterns and processes.

We are part of <a href="https://www.nsercresnet.ca/" target="_blank">**NSERC ResNet**</a>, a network which unites a broad community of scholars, nongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and industry sectors. We work in different regions of Canada, with the common goal of improving how we monitor, model, and manage NCPs. In the next sections we:

1. define what we mean by **spatial and temporal scales**,  
2. discuss the importance of taking a **multi-scale perspective**, and  
3. introduce a few **challenges and best practices** related to scaling.
