We are a team of researchers from the **NSERC/ResNet** [network]([https://www.nsercresnet.ca/]), interested in exploring the issues around scale while dealing with ecosystem services. This story map summarizes the insights and experiences we have gathered while working on our projects.

We, as scientists and researchers, often take a multi-scale perspective to better understand how natural ecosystems improve people’s lives. These beneficial contributions by ecosystems are called **ecosystem services** (ES) or **Nature’s contributions to people** (NCPs). ES or NCPs can also be called nature’s gifts.

Taking a **multi-scale perspective**, means that we can measure things at **fine or small scales**, for example at the scale of ants or even smaller by measuring carbon in a handful of soil, or at **broad or large scales** that give us a bird’s eye perspective of larger ecological patterns and processes.

We are part of **ResNet**, a network which unites a broad community of scholars, nongovernmental organizations, government agencies, and industry sectors. We work in different regions of Canada, with the common goal of improving how we monitor, model, and manage NCPs. In the next sections we:

1. define what we mean by **spatial and temporal scales**,  
2. discuss the importance of taking a **multi-scale perspective**, and  
3. introduce a few **challenges and best practices** related to scaling.
