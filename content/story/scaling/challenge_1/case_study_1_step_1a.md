<!-- ### Case Study 1: Organic carbon stocks of restored salt marshes along the upper Bay of Fundy -->

#### Step 1:  Choosing representative sites and study areas

<!--Four study sites in the Upper Bay of Fundy along the Cumberland Basin were chosen to represent salt marshes at different stages of restoration:  Converse - newly restored, Aulac - restored over 10 years ago, John Lusby - passively restored over 50 years ago, and Wood Point Rest Stop - natural reference site. Sites were chosen to be close to one another (<10 km apart) so environmental conditions like tides and weather were similar between sites. -->

Four sites were chosen in this study to represent salt marshes at different stages of restoration: Converse - newly restored, Aulac - restored over 10 years ago, John Lusby - passively restored over 70 years ago, and Wood Point Rest Stop - natural reference site. Sites were located close to one another (<10 km apart) so environmental conditions like tides and weather were similar between sites. The basemap shows the extent of tidal marsh in the Upper Bay of Fundy along the Cumberland Basin based on geospatial data available in the Canadian National Wetlands Inventory <a href="../references/">[1]</a>.

<!--The Wood Point Rest Stop (WPRS) will be used as an example in this case study. Each site was divided into three elevation zones that are flooded by tides differently throughout the year: the low zone is flooded by 75% of high tides in a year, the mid zone flooded by 50% of high tides, and the high zone is flooded by 25% of high tides. These zones are based on flooding frequency because decomposition of organic matter by microbes is slowed down in flooded, low-oxygen conditions. -->
