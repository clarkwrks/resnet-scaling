### Best Practices and Opportunities

<!-- Collecting field data for scaling requires:
1. Funding and resources. 
2. Background research to plan the most effective sampling scheme to capture as much variability as possible. 
3. A network of researchers, stakeholders, and community members using standard methodologies to allow for the comparison of data across time and space. 
4. Collaboration with people using the data (e.g. modelers) to help identify the type of data that will be needed before it is collected. 

Spending the time planning your field work is essential. Integration of modelers in this planning is even more important if the data is intended to be used in future studies of scaling. Planning ensures unexpected events and missing data can be dealt with and will not influence the overall dataset. -->

<!--Field data challenges and opportunities -->
Field sampling is important for assessing many ecosystem services. However, it is important to have the following points in mind before engaging in field data collection:

1. Carry out substantial background research to choose the most effective sampling methods based on the questions you are trying to answer.
2. Balance the number of samples you need with the funding and resources you have to collect, process, and analyze them.
3. Different studies may use different methods, even when studying the same ecosystem service, so using standard methodologies where possible allows for easier comparison of data across time and space.
4. Since ecosystems often have high spatial and temporal variability, the data collected might not fully capture all the changes and differences happening over time and across the area being studied.
5. Data collected for one study might not work for another study that is trying to look at ecosystem services on a different scale. Integration of modellers in field planning is important if the data is intended to be used in future studies of scaling.
6. Unexpected things, like equipment breaking or bad weather, can happen during field or lab work causing missing data. Spending the time planning ensures unexpected events and missing data can be dealt with and will not influence the overall dataset.
