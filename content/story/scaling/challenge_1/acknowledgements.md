### Acknowledgements

As with any field work campaign, many hands went into collecting and processing this field data. Thank you to Elisha Richardson for providing the <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/146604233/Tidal-Inundation-ArcPy-Model" target="_blank">ArcPy script</a> that was used to create the shapefile layers for the three flooding zones. Thank you to Emily Head, Stephanie MacIntyre, and Leila Rashid for help collecting cores in the field. Also thank you to L. Rashid for help processing bulk density and LOI samples in the lab.  Further thanks to Dr. Gail Chmura for sharing accommodations with us and Dr. Jeff Ollerhead for use of his gouge auger. Many methods used in this case study to collect and process cores were based on guidance in the <a href="https://www.thebluecarboninitiative.org/manual" target="_blank">Blue Carbon</a> Manual by Howard et al. (2014) <a href="../references/">[4]</a>.
