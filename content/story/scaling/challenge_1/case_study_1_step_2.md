Within a designated study area of each site, three random points within each zone were chosen for core extraction using Geographic Information System (GIS) software (ArcGIS Pro) and the location of each point was surveyed using a high-accuracy GPS system. In total, nine cores were collected from each study site. The basemap shows where the nine cores were collected in the Wood Point Rest Stop study site within the three elevation zones.

Cores were collected using a gouge auger (images below), one of the many types of ‘corers’ available to use by soil carbon scientists. Other coring types include the ‘Russian peat corer’ (extracts half a core) and manual extraction (hammering a sharpened tube into the ground). Each of these methods will create different levels of core ‘compaction’, which can affect the overall length of the core and influence the estimate of how much soil organic carbon is contained within each core. Depending on the length of the core, the process of pushing the coring device into the ground and extracting a core can be physically demanding and often requires teamwork.

Transport and handling of cores after they are taken out of the ground is another important consideration for field work. Sometimes cores are cut apart and sub-sampled in the field, and other times cores are packed in rigid plastic shells, wrapped in plastic-wrap, and refrigerated or frozen before being processed back in the lab. In salt marshes, researchers often have to walk far into study sites across uneven terrain with heavy equipment (like the corer and a cooler) to retrieve cores and bring them back.
