### Best practices and opportunities

<!---
1) Carefully consider the aggregation, reporting, or zonal unit by assessing variance or representativeness (i.e., percentage of outcome agreement and disagreement between scales).
2) Consider the effects of aggregating information at the ecologically meaningful level into a socially meaningful or management level. -->

1. Choose reporting unit based on the research question or management context. If these are not clear, assess and report the results from a range of scales and assess the representativeness of the assessed relationship. For example, it is recommended to quantify the percentage of outcome agreement and disagreement between scales, such as supply-demand relationship between cells and watersheds discussed in the case study.

2. Addressing MAUP provides an opportunity to identify most suitable units for the accounting of various ecosystem assets and ecosystem services, given scale-dependent relationships between ecological functions and social activities.
