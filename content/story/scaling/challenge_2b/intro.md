### Introduction

We often report data by summarizing individual information (e.g., at a pixel) to coarser scale analysis units (e.g., census division). In this example, we discuss the consequences of summarizing data to different units.

In addition to the resolution, boundaries used to aggregate smaller scale data may influence the visual assessment of ecosystem service supply and demand information and relationships.
