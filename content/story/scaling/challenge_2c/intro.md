###  Introduction

We often assume that a relationship between two variables is linear; however, if we increase or reduce the spatial extent of a study, we may see a nonlinear relationship appear. This matters because we often use data from one area to make predictions for other areas. If we assume the relationship is linear when itâ€™s not, our predictions will be wrong.
