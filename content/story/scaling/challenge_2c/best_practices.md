### Best practices and opportunities

1. Always choose the spatial extent that makes most sense for the question you are asking

2. When making predictions for a new area, check if the environmental conditions are similar to the original study area. If not, think about whether the relationship between variables might be non-linear

3. Seasonal changes can also create non-linear relationships (like between temperature and time). To handle this, it might be necessary to collect data at the same time each year or more often throughout the year
