## Spatial and temporal scales

As scientists and researchers, we often work at different scales to measure different parts of a landscape or ecosystem. We can measure ecosystems at different scales across **space** (e.g., spatial) or across **time** (e.g., temporal). We can also ask “**how big?**” (e.g., what is the extent?) or “**how much detail?**” (e.g., what is the resolution?).

Caption: When we move from the bottom to the top images, we are increasing the size of the study area (e.g., spatial extent). When we move from the left to the right images, we are increasing the number of pixels per area (e.g., spatial resolution), which allows for individual flowers to be distinguished.

## The spatial and temporal scales of our studies

Research within ResNet takes place across Canada. Here, we show the spatial extent of a selection of our research projects. Each polygon or group of polygons represents the area of study for a project. The icons within the scatter graph represent a subset of  research projects within ResNet. Hover over each icon to learn more about each project.

## Sometimes we move between scales, which creates key challenges and opportunities

When we scale up or down, many challenges can arise. For example the method choices we make can lead to misleading results as we extend our research to other scales. Here, we, as a subset of students and researchers in ResNet, illustrate many of these challenges and provide opportunities for overcoming them.
