### Introduction

Sometimes, the need for an ecosystem service (demand) and the ability of the environment to provide that service (supply) don't match up. No-overlap between supply and demand can occur either in different places (spatial mismatch), at different times (temporal mismatch) or at different scales (scale mismatch).

For example, some insects, small mammals, and birds contribute to fertilization of plants (that is, to pollination) while they are feeding and moving among flowers. Pollinators have to move from their nesting places to their feeding sites. Where pollinators originate from in the landscape is the area of pollination supply. On the other side, demand for pollination occurs where there are plants that need pollination. When there is a large separation between where pollinators originate from (supply) and where they feed and pollinate (demand), supply and demand do not match in space.
