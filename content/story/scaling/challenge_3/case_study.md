### Case study
We'll explore some examples of when demand and supply don't line up using the ecosystem service of pollination as an example. This mismatch 
can happen in three main ways:

1) **Spatial mismatch**: If we look at different landscapes, even when there's the same amount of space for pollinators, some farmlands may have 
more pollinators simply because their crops are closer to nesting sites. The location and the configuration of nesting sites can influence the 
availability of pollinators inside fields. For example, studies in crop fields show that the abundance of pollinators tends to be higher in 
smaller crop fields (e.g. 2 ha) than in large ones (e.g. 100 ha). If crop fields' edges have suitable places for pollinators to nest, then 
pollinators will find it easier to fly to the center of the field and pollinate smaller fields compared to larger fields. The plants in the 
center of a large field might be out of reach for some pollinators, given their limited flying range.

2) **Temporal mismatch**: Not all pollinators are active at the same time nor during all seasons of crop blooming. Crops may bloom at times that 
do not always coincide with all insects’s periods of high activity. As the climate changes, the periods of time when crops bloom and the periods 
of time when bees have high activity may no longer align, which may result in greater temporal mismatches.

3) **Scale mismatch**: The entire process of pollination needs a specific size and arrangement of the land. One farmer might not have enough land to 
establish a nice hedgerow or a flower strip to support the pollinators, or arrange it in the best way for them. But if many farmers work together, 
they might be able to create the right conditions for pollinators. This means that encouraging cooperation between farmers might be more successful 
than asking one farmer to increase bee-friendly habitats. This is because the size of a single farm might be too small to match the large-scale needs 
of the pollination process, and this is an example of scale mismatch.

Researchers from ResNet are investigating the mismatches between supply and demand of pollination in the agricultural fields of the county of La Vallée-du-Richelieu (region outlined in blue), and how restoration of wild-bee habitat could enhance crop pollination (Torchio et al. Submitted).
