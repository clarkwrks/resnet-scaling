<h2 id="the-importance-of-field-sampling-and-data-collection-for-scaling-of-ecosystem-services">The importance of field sampling and data collection for scaling of ecosystem services</h2>
<p>We often need detailed data to detect change. In this example, we discuss why we need data at finer pixel sizes to detect forest losses and gains.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Field studies (e.g., measuring ecosystems directly) seek to capture as much detail in time and space as possible, given the question and the availability of time and funds. In this example we show the origin story of collecting field data and explain why collecting field data takes time, creativity, and perseverance</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Scaling requires data. For many ecosystem services, data is collected through field sampling. Many challenges exist when conducting field work to collect data, including the trade-off between the number of data points needed and the time and resources available to collect, process, and analyze field samples. Background research is conducted to choose a proper sampling scheme for the ecological questions being explored. Data collected for one study’s questions may not be applicable to a study that aims to scale ecosystem services up (or down). Further, methodologies used to collect field data may not be the same between similar studies exploring the same ecosystem service. Unexpected situations often occur while conducting field or lab work (e.g. equipment breaking or weather events) and often information can be missing from datasets. Finally, the heterogeneity of the environment does not guarantee that data points collected reflect the true spatial and temporal variability that exists in the ecosystem being studied. This section will describe the challenges and best practices of collecting soil carbon data from two different ecosystems - salt marshes along the Bay of Fundy and forests and agricultural land in the Northwest Territories.</p>
<h3 id="case-study-1--organic-carbon-stocks-of-restored-salt-marshes-along-the-upper-bay-of-fundy">Case Study 1:  Organic carbon stocks of restored salt marshes along the upper Bay of Fundy</h3>
<h4 id="step-1--choosing-representative-sites-and-study-areas">Step 1:  Choosing representative sites and study areas</h4>
<p><img src="images/image4.png" alt="fig1">
Caption:  Four study sites in the Upper Bay of Fundy along the Cumberland Basin were chosen to represent salt marshes at different stages of restoration:  Converse - newly restored, Aulac - restored over 10 years ago, John Lusby - passively restored over 50 years ago, and Wood Point Rest Stop - natural reference site. Sites were chosen to be close to one another (&lt;10 km apart) so environmental conditions like tides and weather were similar between sites.</p>
<p><img src="images/image7.png" alt="fig2">
Caption:  The Wood Point Rest Stop (WPRS) will be used as an example in this case study. Each site was divided into three elevation zones that are flooded by tides differently throughout the year:  the low zone is flooded by 75% of high tides in a year, the mid zone flooded by 50% of high tides, and the high zone is flooded by 25% of high tides. These zones are based on flooding frequency because decomposition of organic matter by microbes is slowed down in flooded, low-oxygen conditions.</p>
<h4 id="step-2--collection-of-sediment-cores">Step 2:  Collection of sediment cores</h4>
<p><img src="images/survey.jpg" alt="fig3">
Caption:  Three random points within each zone were chosen for core extraction using Geographic Information System (GIS) software (ArcGIS Pro) and the location of each point was surveyed using a high-accuracy GPS system. In total, nine cores were collected from each study site. The photo above shows someone surveying core locations at the Aulac site. The map below shows the location of nine cores in the Wood Point Rest Stop study site within the three elevation zones.</p>
<p><img src="images/image40.png" alt="fig4"></p>
<p><img src="images/image17.png" alt="fig5"></p>
<p><img src="images/corer1.jpg" alt="fig6 top"></p>
<p><img src="images/corer2.jpg" alt="fig7 left"></p>
<p><img src="images/corer3.jpg" alt="fig8 right"></p>
<p>Caption:  Cores were collected using a gouge auger, one of the many types of ‘corers’ available to use by soil carbon scientists. Other coring types include the ‘Russian peat corer’ (extracts half a core) and manual extraction (hammering a sharpened tube into the ground). Each of these methods will create different levels of core ‘compaction’, which can affect the overall length of the core and influence the estimate of how much soil organic carbon is contained within each core. Depending on the length of the core, the process of pushing the coring device into the ground and extracting a core can be physically demanding and often requires teamwork.</p>
<p><img src="images/corePVC.jpg" alt="fig9 left"></p>
<p><img src="images/cooler.jpg" alt="fig10 right"></p>
<p>Caption:  Transport and handling of cores after they are taken out of the ground is another important consideration for field work. Sometimes cores are cut apart and sampled in the field, and other times cores are packed in rigid plastic shells, wrapped in plastic-wrap, and refrigerated or frozen before being processed back in the lab. In salt marshes, researchers often have to walk far into study sites across uneven terrain with heavy equipment (like the corer and a cooler) to retrieve cores and bring them back.</p>
<h4 id="step-3--processing-of-cores-in-the-lab">Step 3:  Processing of cores in the lab</h4>
<p><img src="images/con_h3.jpg" alt="fig11 left"></p>
<p><img src="images/cutcore.jpg" alt="fig12 right"></p>
<p>Caption:  Once back in the lab, processing the core starts. The cores are photographed and different features like soil colour and texture are described and recorded. Then cores are divided into different increments depending on the goals of the study. For this study, 5 cm increments were chosen for a total of 10 per 50 cm core, which means that 360 individual samples were processed! When dividing cores, a compression factor should be used to adjust the increment length based on the compaction measured in the field. Compaction is often assumed equal across the entirety of the core.</p>
<p><img src="images/bd1.jpg" alt="fig13 top-left"></p>
<p><img src="images/bd2.jpg" alt="fig14 top-right"></p>
<p><img src="images/bd3.jpg" alt="fig15 bottom-left"></p>
<p><img src="images/bd4.jpg" alt="fig16 bottom-right"></p>
<p>Caption: To calculate how much organic carbon is in a core, two measurements are needed - ‘bulk density’ and ‘organic carbon content’ or ‘% organic carbon’. Core increments are usually sampled for bulk density first, which is a measure of the dry weight of soil within a known volume of the core. In the photo above, a metal cylinder was inserted into the centre of each 5 cm increment. The soil sample was extracted using a syringe plunger and then dried in an oven (see Step 4). Often the same soil sample is also used to determine the organic carbon content of the increment, but others can be cut from the core and stored until they are processed.</p>
<p><img src="images/Wp_l1.jpg" alt="fig16 "></p>
<p>Caption:  Once processing is done, any remaining core segments are often archived and frozen for future analyses. Freezer and refrigerator space is a very important factor to consider when taking soil cores and designing the field study, as cores should be kept cold (&lt; 4℃) to prevent decomposition of organic matter by microbes.</p>
<h4 id="step-4--lab-analyses-for-bulk-density-and-loss-on-ignition-loi">Step 4:  Lab analyses for bulk density and loss-on-ignition (LOI)</h4>
<p><img src="images/dry1.jpg" alt="fig17 left"></p>
<p><img src="images/dry2.jpg" alt="fig18 right"></p>
<p>Caption:  The soil samples of known volume taken from the core are first dried to determine the bulk density. Wet samples are placed in individually labeled tins, weighed, and then dried at 60 ℃ in a drying oven for 24-72 hours (or until a consistent dried weight is reached). After they are completely dry, they are re-weighed to determine dry weight of the soil sample. The photos above show the dried soil cylinders in a dessicator after the oven, which ensures the samples are fully dried before being re-weighed. Bulk density is written as the dry weight of soil divided by the known volume of the sample (g/cm3). Low bulk density means there is not a lot of soil within the volume of core sampled, which means the soil is less densely packed and there are more air pockets. Soils with low bulk density often have high organic matter content and water-holding capacity (like a sponge!).</p>
<p><img src="images/mortar1.jpg" alt="fig19 top-left"></p>
<p><img src="images/roots.jpg" alt="fig20 top-right"></p>
<p><img src="images/mortar2.jpg" alt="fig21 bottom"></p>
<p>Caption:  After the soil samples are dried and bulk density is determined, the soil samples are often processed for loss-on-ignition (LOI), which is an estimate of how much ‘organic matter’ is a soil sample. Before the samples are put into the furnace, small roots (&gt; 2 mm) should be removed and the soil sample needs to be crushed into a homogenous sample, often using a mortar and pestle. Sometimes a sieve can be used to remove the small root particles, but often this step requires picking out small pieces of roots by hand using tweezers, which can be quite time consuming! Roots &gt;2 mm are considered belowground biomass, which is different from the organic carbon that is stored in the soil.</p>
<p><img src="images/loi1.jpg" alt="fig22 top"></p>
<p><img src="images/loi2.jpg" alt="fig23 bottom-left"></p>
<p><img src="images/loi3.jpg" alt="fig24 bottom-right"></p>
<p>Caption:  LOI involves combusting the soil sample at a high temperature (550 ℃) in a muffle furnace for 4 hours. Before the soil samples are put into the furnace, they are placed in a ceramic crucible and weighed to a consistent starting weight. After the samples are combusted, they are re-weighed to determine how much mass was lost, which corresponds to how much organic matter was burnt off from the sample and is represented by ‘% organic matter’ of the sample. Sometimes accidents happen but often duplicate or triplicate samples are done for LOI. For this study, half the samples had duplicates, for a total of 480 samples processed. As only 15 can fit in the muffle furnace at once, and the furnace often sits overnight to cool off after 4 hours, it can take a significant amount of time to get through that many samples (480 / 15 = 32 days!). Soil carbon scientists often use different methods for LOI, which may affect the comparison of results between datasets. As there is no standard method, it is recommended to report and be consistent in three parameters: ignition temperature, exposure time, and starting weight.</p>
<h4 id="step-5--data-processing-and-interpretation">Step 5:  Data processing and interpretation</h4>
<p><img src="images/Craft1991.jpg" alt="fig25 top"></p>
<p>Caption:  Once bulk density and % organic matter are determined, the ‘organic carbon density’ of each increment of the core can be estimated. Often % organic matter (%OM) is converted to % organic carbon (%OC) in salt marshes using a known conversion equation published in the scientific literature or roughly estimated by simply dividing %OM by 2. Some studies choose to determine the exact amount of organic carbon (%OC) in their samples by conducting ‘elemental analysis’ or sending the samples to another lab to do this analysis. More and more studies are now sending at least a subset of samples away to determine their own %OM-to-%OC conversion equations. Either way, this step involves more time to process samples or more money to pay for the analysis. In addition, soil samples should be treated to remove any inorganic carbon so elemental analysis results only reflect total organic carbon. The figure above is pulled directly from Craft et al. 1991 and shows the relationship between %OM and %OC for brackish and salt marsh sediments in North Carolina. For the data presented below in this case study, a local equation for %OM-to%OC was developed using data from sites located in the Upper Bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>Caption:  Once %OC of the increment is determined, this can be multiplied by the bulk density (g/cm3) to determine the organic carbon density of the core. Organic carbon density (g OC/cm3) is then multiplied by the height of each increment (5 cm in this example) to determine the amount of carbon within each core depth increment (g OC/cm2). Then all increments are added together to get the total ‘soil organic carbon stock’ throughout the core’s depth. This organic carbon stock (g OC/cm2 to 50 cm depth) can be scaled up to larger areas and compared to other studies. A common unit for carbon stock is megagrams (or tonnes) per hectare (Mg/ha). The figure above shows how to get from bulk density and %OC to total organic carbon stock and how to convert g/cm2 to Mg/ha using an example core from this case study. It’s important to note that if the Craft et al. 1991 equation was used to convert from %OM to %OC in this system, the organic carbon stock in this core would be overestimated by 100% or double (62 Mg/ha vs 31 Mg/ha OC).</p>

<h4 id="step-1-choosing-representative-sites-and-study-areas">Step 1: Choosing representative sites and study areas</h4>
<p><img src="images/image23.jpg" alt="fig27"></p>
<p>Caption: We partnered with communities in the Northwest Territories, Canada such as Kakisa (shown here) to understand carbon and fertility trade-offs associated with agricultural cultivation of the boreal forest</p>
<p><img src="images/image3.png" alt="fig28"></p>
<p>Caption: In 2019, a soil sampling effort was conducted to assess the soil fertility and carbon content of sites that communities were interested in for agricultural development. Study sites were selected across a gradient of potential agriculture suitability ranging from class 3 (potentially the most suitable for agriculture) to class 7 (likely unsuitable for agriculture). Sites were also selected based on input from local community members</p>
<p><img src="images/image19.png" alt="fig29"></p>
<p>Caption: In 2021, a soil collection effort was undertaken to understand how soil fertility and carbon change between three different land use types; pre-cultivated forest soil, active agricultural soils, and abandoned agricultural soils. In partnership with seven farmers, 22 total sites were sampled.</p>

<p>Caption: Cores were collected using a 30cm or 60cm stainless steel soil corer to capture the entire organic layer of the site. For each transect, six soil cores were collected. Once extracted from the ground, cores were placed and sealed in plastic tubes.</p>
<p><img src="images/image25.jpg" alt="fig33"></p>
<p>Caption: Soil cores were stored in a freezer to limit decomposition processes. Upon departure from the Northwest territories, samples were shipped back to the University of Guelph and stored at 4 degrees celsius.</p>

<p><img src="images/image24.png" alt="fig34"></p>
<p>Caption: The entirety of the organic layer of the soil cores was analyzed to determine soil macronutrient fertility (consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) as well as soil organic carbon stocks.</p>
<p><img src="images/image26.png" alt="fig35"></p>
<p>Caption: Soil cores were subdivided into 5cm increments to assess how variables change with depth throughout the core</p>
<p><img src="images/image28.png" alt="fig36"></p>
<p>Caption: In total over 1500lbs of soil was analyzed and processed  from 2019-2022 in support of this project.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-data-interpretation">Step 4: Data interpretation</h4>
<p><img src="images/image8.png" alt="fig37"></p>
<p>Caption: Based on the soil data we collected and the results of a global synthesis of studies, we found that soil organic carbon stocks significantly decline with increasing time since cultivation. This is concerning as the boreal forest represents the largest pool of terrestrial carbon.</p>
<p><img src="images/image13.png" alt="fig38"></p>
<p>Caption: We also found differing relationships between soil organic carbon and soil fertility in our study sites. In agricultural soils (both active and abandoned) soil fertility and soil carbon are positively correlated. In pre-cultivation or undisturbed sites, soil fertility and soil carbon are negatively correlated. This negative correlation is important from a land management perspective as we can target areas of high fertility, but low soil carbon to limit potential carbon losses.</p>
<p><img src="images/image2.png" alt="fig39"></p>
<p>Caption: We were able to use the soil data to create a map that highlights areas of lower amounts of soil organic carbon (shown in white) and high macronutrient fertility (larger circles). This serves as a preliminary land management tool that can help communities make decisions that limit carbon losses upon cultivation</p>
<h3 id="best-practices-and-opportunities">Best Practices and Opportunities</h3>
<p>Collecting field data for scaling requires (1) funding &amp; resources, (2) background research to plan the most effective sampling scheme to capture as much variability as possible, (3) a network of researchers, stakeholders, and community members using standard methodologies to allow for the comparison of data across time and space, and (4) collaboration with people using the data (e.g. modelers) to help identify the type of data that will be needed before it is collected.</p>
<p>Spending the time planning your field work is essential. Integration of modelers in this planning is even more important if the data is intended to be used in future studies of scaling. Planning ensures unexpected events and missing data can be dealt with and will not influence the overall dataset.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Relationships may differ over time or space. This example discusses the consequences of generalizing our results outside of the original study area.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Often we assume a relationship between two variables is linear; however, if we increase the spatial extent we may see a nonlinear relationship appear. This is important, because we often predict in areas outside of where we sample. If we assume a relationship is linear, when it is not, then our extrapolations will be incorrect.</p>
<h3 id="case-study">Case study</h3>
<p>In this case study, we show the relationship between soil carbon and plant cover in vacant lots in Quebec city. Plant cover can be greater than one in densely vegetated vacant lots when leaves overlap. In this study, vacant lots were carefully selected to represent the entire range of plant cover. However, a less careful scientist could have selected only a subset of these vacant lots (green dots on map). The relationship between soil carbon and plant cover only within this subset (green dots on map) is linear (green line) and would lead to an incorrect extrapolation to the whole study region. When using data from the whole study region (e.g., increasing the spatial extent), we find that the relationship is actually non-linear (gray line). In vacant lots with high plant cover, other factors (e.g., soil type, land use history, etc.) might be needed to better explain the variability of carbon.</p>

<p>If funding and time allows, sample across a larger spatial extent to capture the full range of each variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When extrapolating outside of the original study region consider whether the new study region’s environmental variables are within the same range as the original study. If not, consider whether a non-linear relationship is likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seasonality can also result in nonlinear relationships between a variable and time (e.g., temperature). To account for variables that vary across a year, we may need to monitor at the same time each year or more frequently within the year. Phenological changes are shifting with continuing climate change, which makes monitoring more frequently over time especially important.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>To understand whether an ecosystem is changing, we measure it over time. However, if we only measure the ecosystem over a short time, then we may not detect a change, even when the ecosystem has changed. This example explores how the monitoring time-period influences outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Often we use time series analysis to understand whether an ecosystem property or service is changing over time. The temporal extent (e.g., time frame or period) of the monitoring data can affect outcomes. For shorter time-series or time-series with high variability, we may not have a correct historical baseline to detect change. For example, if monitoring data does not extend far enough into the past, then an insignificant trend could be interpreted as evidence for stability or no effect, when in reality the system might already be in a degraded state.</p>
<h3 id="case-study">Case study</h3>
<p>In this example, we show how Chinook salmon populations are changing in the Salmon river, British Columbia, Canada. In this region, Chinook salmon are important for the way of life for Indigenous communities, the economy, and the environment. Here, we show differences in trend significance depending on the start of a monitoring program. For example, if salmon monitoring only started 10 or 20 years ago (click on “since 2010” or “since 2000” buttons), then no significant downward trend would have been detected. However, if we begin our time-series analysis in 1984, then we see a significant downward trend: slope = -0.046 and p-value &lt; 0.001.</p>

<p>Even when monitoring data are available for 30+ years, we know ecosystems have been changing over centuries. For example, current observations of salmon in the Salmon River are very different from historical reports.</p>
<p>“In the grey of early morning I … found the river full of sockeye running upstream. I put in an oar and felt that the river was half fish. The increasing light soon showed that it was red from bank to bank. Then a stampede or panic occurred, and the salmon came surging down, but the river was so full of ascending fish that they blockaded and made a great flat wriggling dam. So jammed were they that they crowded out, and were rushed up the sloping banks out of the water.” -David Salmond Mitchell, fisheries officer 1905</p>

<p>When appropriate historical baselines are unavailable, comparisons can be made with an equivalent reference site. However, in the age of the anthropocene, finding an appropriate reference site can also be challenging. Therefore, when reading papers and reports, we suggest critically evaluating how baselines and reference sites were selected and how these choices could impact outcomes.</p>

<p>We often report data by summarizing individual information (e.g., at a pixel) to coarser scale analysis units (e.g., census division). In this example, we discuss the consequences of summarizing data to different units.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In addition to the resolution, boundaries used to aggregate smaller scale data may influence the visual assessment of ecosystem service supply and demand information and relationships.</p>
<h3 id="case-study">Case study</h3>
<p>Pollination supply and demand aggregated to watersheds (left) tend to show ecosystem service surplus (i.e. higher ratios) at areas with little demand, while the supply and demand relationships represented at 3km grid cells (right) can help identify more precisely high demand areas that could benefit from more agricultural support.</p>
