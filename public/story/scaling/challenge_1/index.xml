      <description>Challenge 1: The importance of field sampling and data collection for scaling of ecosystem services Introduction Scaling requires data. For many ecosystem services, data is collected through field sampling. Many challenges exist when conducting field work to collect data, including the trade-off between the number of data points needed and the time and resources available to collect, process, and analyze field samples. Background research is conducted to choose a proper sampling scheme for the ecological questions being explored.</description>
